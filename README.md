# TBA README
Task Booster Assistant
We are creating a website that is dedicated to help the user manage and schedule their tasks<br/> 
We use automatic sorting of the project's urgency based on the Eisenhower Matrix and would sort the tasks based on their urgency and importance<br/>
We are writting this project using Javascript/HTML<br/> 

# Features
